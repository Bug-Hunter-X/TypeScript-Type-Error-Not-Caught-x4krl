This repo contains a simple TypeScript program demonstrating a type error that is not caught by the compiler. The function `add` is defined to take two numbers as arguments and return their sum. However, the program calls `add` with a string and a number. This results in a runtime error, because the `+` operator performs string concatenation instead of addition when one of the operands is a string. The bug is that the TypeScript compiler does not issue an error when this code is compiled, which can lead to unexpected behavior at runtime. A fix for this bug is provided in the `bugSolution.ts` file.
